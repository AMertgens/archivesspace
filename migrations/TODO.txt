- containers not showing up in tracer spreadsheet rightmost column
- looks like instances aren't showing up in front end after import


- validate XML files against schema (using libxml)
	- where to do this?

- class level validator for options?
	- ensure the backend knows about the vocab, repo
	- ensure the importer exists
	- ensure the crosswalk and the source file match
	- etc.

- option to create new vocabs based on incoming subject attributes ("lcsh", etc.)

- revisit allow-failures
	
- change 'path' to 'key' in import.rb CLI for crosswalk option
