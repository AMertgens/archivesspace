- hook up agents to archival objects and resources on import



- fix problem of ambiguity of multiple possible property setters:
	- restore 'set once' rule, or
	- destroy and xpath array after a single value property gets set

- create helper methods to render reports and other messages
	appropriate for context (HTML, CLI, etc.)
	
- address problem of circular waiting among json objects
	- write the test (a -b -c)

	- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection_(graph_theory)

- validate XML files against schema (using libxml)
	- where to do this?

- class level validator for options?
	- ensure the backend knows about the vocab, repo
	- ensure the importer exists
	- ensure the crosswalk and the source file match
	- etc.

- debug mode

- option to create new vocabs based on incoming subject attributes ("lcsh", etc.)

- revisit allow-failures
	
- create measurements for speed and memory usage

- refactor ancestor relationships setter

- change 'path' to 'key' in import.rb CLI for crosswalk option

- add init options to ASpaceImport module
	- perhaps allow loaded importers to be restricted (i.e., xml only for webapps)
